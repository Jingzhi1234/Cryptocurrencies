# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
I am using unsupervised learning to process, cluster, reduce cryptocurrency data dimensions, and reduce the principal components using PCA. By doing these strategies, I am able to offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio. And use data visualizations to share my findings with the board.

## step 1: Preprocessing the Data

For step 1, I removed NA rows, removed useless columns, filtered rows with some criteria, created dummy variables for columns, and standardized columns

## step 2: principal component analysis

diminish feature to 3

## step 3: Clustering

using elbow curve to find the best k values in order to better cluster data into groups

## step 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

Scale the TotalCoinSupply and TotalCoinsMined columns between the given range of zero and one
Create 3D plot for pc1, pc2 and pc3
Create 2D plot with x="TotalCoinsMined" and y="TotalCoinSupply"
